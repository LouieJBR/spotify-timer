# spotify-timer

This will be a light-weight web application that integrates with the Spotify API.

A user can sign in via Spotify and can create timers out of their saved songs etc...

The user will specify the length of the timer and the API will retrieve the playlist they have selected as the base.

Our API will extract song length and Id, convert the length into seconds and use a mathematical approach to find the combination of songs that sum up to the length of the desired timer.
